Unlike in vanilla Minecraft, it is not as easy as adding an ingredient to a Brewing Stand and waiting for it to finish when using Brewery. Depending on the Recipe the whole process can be difficult and time-consuming. Some Recipes may need high precision when it comes to ingredients or any other step in the process. If one step is not good enough, the quality of the Potions may suffer, leading to side effects like bad alcohol and other toxins.

This new difficulty of brewing the good stuff makes only sense, if the players are not aware of the exact Recipes for at least the more valuable Potions (like Rum). This makes high-quality potions worth much more and an experimenting and perfecting of the Brewing Process would be promoted.

Depending on the Recipe, some Steps may not be needed, the following instruction describes the common procedure of brewing.

## Fermenting

Step one consists of Fermenting the fresh Ingredients.

1. Place Cauldron over a fire or other heat source
2. Fill it with water
3. Add Ingredients with a right-click
4. Wait a few minutes while they ferment
5. Fill in glass bottles

Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting.

## Distilling
Some Recipes don't need distilling.
1. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand
2. Put glowstone dust as a filter on top of the brewing stand (The filter will not be consumed)

## Aging

The [Minecraft-Barrel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Barrel) can be used for aging of a few brews.
Simply craft and place the barrel and put the brews inside.

## Drinking

The amount of alcohol inside the Brew will be applied to the player when drinking. Depending on the quality of it, that may have different effects.

* The Player may not be able to walk normally anymore, he will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight
* Effects like Blindness, Confusion, Poison etc. occur
* The Chat will be altered depending on drunkenness, many things players write may be incomprehensible, and sometimes it seems senseless
* Is the Alcohol particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects
* After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting
* When logging off, the player may have difficulties reaching his character, thus some logins shortly after may be denied
* After Overdrinking the player may faint (Disconnecting)

## Brew Sealing - for chest shops

You can just give your created Brews to other Players and they might even put them back into a Barrel to keep aging them.
But our chest shop plugin requires sold items to be exactly equal and this is where sealing comes in. Imagine it like putting a seal on the bottle.

* First, you need to craft a Sealing Table
* It is crafted with 2 Bottles over 4 Planks
* Putting a brew into the Sealing table will equalize it, making it equal to other Brews that have been brewed similarly.
* Sealed Brews cannot be aged or modified any further and they don't show their details anymore

## Getting Sober

After drinking it takes a while until the alcohol is completely gone. During that time the alcohol level is steadily decreasing. Also, it can be decreased through consuming of items defined in the config.

* When logging off extremely drunk, it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, he may find himself at a completely unknown Place in the middle of nowhere having no idea how he got there.
* But if he logs back in after some hours or the next morning, he will find himself at /home, again without any memories.
* Also if the Alcohol is not of the best quality, the player may face some bad type of hangover (slowness and hunger).
