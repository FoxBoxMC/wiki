## When Does the Server Restart?
The servers restart every day at 6 AM GMT. You do not get kicked from the server as it automatically reconnects you.

## How Is Admin Abuse Prevented?
There are 3 distinct servers: The proxy; which handles connecting and bans. The SMP; which you play on. And everything else. In the proxy, staff slowly build up permissions so we can monitor how they handle punishing players. Usually, court is given but some cases need immediate action. In the SMP server, the staff starts with spectator mode, restores, replay clipping, and inspecting tools. In all other servers, the staff is given more slightly abusive commands as these are quick servers, like events with no real impact. When a user is caught breaking a rule, a replay is clipped by the staff member and they are brought to court.

## Why Are Some Players in Spectator?
They aren't in spectator mode, this just means they are on a different server. You can run /glist to see all of the servers and which ones the players are in. Most likely, they are inside of the hub because of the minigames servers.

## How Long Do Server Updates Take?
Updates happen as soon as all plugins are stable on that version. Some updates, such as 1.20.5 will break a lot of Minecraft's plugin functions, so they take a while. I will always run a test server beforehand to make sure everything works. If everything goes well, downtime lasts less than an hour. 

## What is Court?
Court is our system to punish people with leniency. This system will stay in place for as long as we can manage it. Three strikes are lenient. After that, it's managed through stricter methods and will affect your chances of becoming staff. Someone unrelated to the ban will usually be the judge. The prosecutor would be the staff who caught you. You have the chance of pleading guilty or not guilty. It's usually better to plead guilty as you don't waste others' time. Once the court is done, appropriate action will be taken, such as your items being wiped if you x-rayed.
