# Welcome To FoxBox's Docs!
This site is used for quick guides which would be inconvenient to view in-game. 
You can find a lot of these pages using the quick menu. Others may be found on the Discord.
On the top right of this page is a button to get to our Discord if needed.

[^1]: All of the pages are publicly editable. You can edit every page on this site. Scroll down to the footer for the link.
[^2]: You can create suggestions on Discord for missing wiki pages. This helps us out a lot if we forget something.
